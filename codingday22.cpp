/*Minimum Number of Pushes to Type Word II
You are given a string word containing lowercase English letters.
Telephone keypads have keys mapped with distinct collections of lowercase English letters, which can be used to form words by pushing them. For example, the key 2 is mapped with ["a","b","c"], we need to push the key one time to type "a", two times to type "b", and three times to type "c" .
It is allowed to remap the keys numbered 2 to 9 to distinct collections of letters. The keys can be remapped to any amount of letters, but each letter must be mapped to exactly one key. You need to find the minimum number of times the keys will be pushed to type the string word.
Return the minimum number of pushes needed to type word after remapping the keys.
An example mapping of letters to keys on a telephone keypad is given below. Note that 1, *, #, and 0 do not map to any letters.*/
/*Input: word = "abcde"
Output: 5
Explanation: The remapped keypad given in the image provides the minimum cost.
"a" -> one push on key 2
"b" -> one push on key 3
"c" -> one push on key 4
"d" -> one push on key 5
"e" -> one push on key 6
Total cost is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.
It can be shown that no other mapping can provide a lower cost.
Input: word = "xyzxyzxyzxyz"
Output: 12
Explanation: The remapped keypad given in the image provides the minimum cost.
"x" -> one push on key 2
"y" -> one push on key 3
"z" -> one push on key 4
Total cost is 1 * 4 + 1 * 4 + 1 * 4 = 12
It can be shown that no other mapping can provide a lower cost.
Note that the key 9 is not mapped to any letter: it is not necessary to map letters to every key, but to map all the letters.
Input: word = "aabbccddeeffgghhiiiiii"
Output: 24
Explanation: The remapped keypad given in the image provides the minimum cost.
"a" -> one push on key 2
"b" -> one push on key 3
"c" -> one push on key 4
"d" -> one push on key 5
"e" -> one push on key 6
"f" -> one push on key 7
"g" -> one push on key 8
"h" -> two pushes on key 9
"i" -> one push on key 9
Total cost is 1 * 2 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 2 + 2 * 2 + 6 * 1 = 24.
It can be shown that no other mapping can provide a lower cost.*/

/*
 Finding the Users Active Minutes
You are given the logs for users' actions on LeetCode, and an integer k. The logs are represented by a 2D integer array logs where each logs[i] = [IDi, timei] indicates that the user with IDi performed an action at the minute timei.
Multiple users can perform actions simultaneously, and a single user can perform multiple actions in the same minute.
The user active minutes (UAM) for a given user is defined as the number of unique minutes in which the user performed an action on LeetCode. A minute can only be counted once, even if multiple actions occur during it.
You are to calculate a 1-indexed array answer of size k such that, for each j (1 <= j <= k), answer[j] is the number of users whose UAM equals j.
Return the array answer as described above.
Example 1:
Input: logs = [[0,5],[1,2],[0,2],[0,5],[1,3]], k = 5
Output: [0,2,0,0,0]
Explanation:
The user with ID=0 performed actions at minutes 5, 2, and 5 again. Hence, they have a UAM of 2 (minute 5 is only counted once).
The user with ID=1 performed actions at minutes 2 and 3. Hence, they have a UAM of 2.
Since both users have a UAM of 2, answer[2] is 2, and the remaining answer[j] values are 0.
Example 2:
Input: logs = [[1,1],[2,2],[2,3]], k = 4
Output: [1,1,0,0]
Explanation:
The user with ID=1 performed a single action at minute 1. Hence, they have a UAM of 1.
The user with ID=2 performed actions at minutes 2 and 3. Hence, they have a UAM of 2.
There is one user with a UAM of 1 and one with a UAM of 2.
Hence, answer[1] = 1, answer[2] = 1, and the remaining values are 0*/

/* Product of the Last K Numbers
Design an algorithm that accepts a stream of integers and retrieves the product of the last k integers of the stream.
Implement the ProductOfNumbers class:
ProductOfNumbers() Initializes the object with an empty stream.
void add(int num) Appends the integer num to the stream.
int getProduct(int k) Returns the product of the last k numbers in the current list. You can assume that always the current list has at least k numbers.
The test cases are generated so that, at any time, the product of any contiguous sequence of numbers will fit into a single 32-bit integer without overflowing.
Example:
Input
["ProductOfNumbers","add","add","add","add","add","getProduct","getProduct","getProduct","add","getProduct"]
[[],[3],[0],[2],[5],[4],[2],[3],[4],[8],[2]]
Output
[null,null,null,null,null,null,20,40,0,null,32]
Explanation
ProductOfNumbers productOfNumbers = new ProductOfNumbers();
productOfNumbers.add(3);        // [3]
productOfNumbers.add(0);        // [3,0]
productOfNumbers.add(2);        // [3,0,2]
productOfNumbers.add(5);        // [3,0,2,5]
productOfNumbers.add(4);        // [3,0,2,5,4]
productOfNumbers.getProduct(2); // return 20. The product of the last 2 numbers is 5 * 4 = 20
productOfNumbers.getProduct(3); // return 40. The product of the last 3 numbers is 2 * 5 * 4 = 40
productOfNumbers.getProduct(4); // return 0. The product of the last 4 numbers is 0 * 2 * 5 * 4 = 0
