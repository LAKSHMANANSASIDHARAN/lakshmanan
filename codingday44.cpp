/*Lexicographically Smallest Palindrome
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters, and you are allowed to perform operations on it. In one operation, you can replace a character in s with another lowercase English letter.
Your task is to make s a palindrome with the minimum number of operations possible. If there are multiple palindromes that can be made using the minimum number of operations, make the lexicographically smallest one.
A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b (of the same length) if in the first position where a and b differ, string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b.
Return the resulting palindrome string.
Example 1:
Input: s = "egcfe"
Output: "efcfe"
Explanation: The minimum number of operations to make "egcfe" a palindrome is 1, and the lexicographically smallest palindrome string we can get by modifying one character is "efcfe", by changing 'g'.
Example 2:
Input: s = "abcd"
Output: "abba"
Explanation: The minimum number of operations to make "abcd" a palindrome is 2, and the lexicographically smallest palindrome string we can get by modifying two characters is "abba".
Example 3:
Input: s = "seven"
Output: "neven"
Explanation: The minimum number of operations to make "seven" a palindrome is 1, and the lexicographically smallest palindrome string we can get by modifying one character is "neven".*/

/*Flipping an Image
Given an n x n binary matrix image, flip the image horizontally, then invert it, and return the resulting image.
To flip an image horizontally means that each row of the image is reversed.
For example, flipping [1,1,0] horizontally results in [0,1,1].
To invert an image means that each 0 is replaced by 1, and each 1 is replaced by 0.
For example, inverting [0,1,1] results in [1,0,0].
Example 1:
Input: image = [[1,1,0],[1,0,1],[0,0,0]]
Output: [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]
Explanation: First reverse each row: [[0,1,1],[1,0,1],[0,0,0]].
Then, invert the image: [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]
Example 2:
Input: image = [[1,1,0,0],[1,0,0,1],[0,1,1,1],[1,0,1,0]]
Output: [[1,1,0,0],[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,1],[1,0,1,0]]
Explanation: First reverse each row: [[0,0,1,1],[1,0,0,1],[1,1,1,0],[0,1,0,1]].
Then invert the image: [[1,1,0,0],[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,1],[1,0,1,0]]*/
