/*Split a String in Balanced Strings
Balanced strings are those that have an equal quantity of 'L' and 'R' characters.
Given a balanced string s, split it into some number of substrings such that:
Each substring is balanced.
Return the maximum number of balanced strings you can obtain.
Example 1:
Input: s = "RLRRLLRLRL"
Output: 4
Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "RRLL", "RL", "RL", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.
Example 2:
Input: s = "RLRRRLLRLL"
Output: 2
Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "RRRLLRLL", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.
Note that s cannot be split into "RL", "RR", "RL", "LR", "LL", because the 2nd and 5th substrings are not balanced.
Example 3:
Input: s = "LLLLRRRR"
Output: 1
Explanation: s can be split into "LLLLRRRR".*/

/*Minimum Number of Moves to Seat Everyone
There are n availabe seats and n students standing in a room. You are given an array seats of length n, where seats[i] is the position of the ith seat. You are also given the array students of length n, where students[j] is the position of the jth student.
You may perform the following move any number of times:
Increase or decrease the position of the ith student by 1 (i.e., moving the ith student from position x to x + 1 or x - 1)
Return the minimum number of moves required to move each student to a seat such that no two students are in the same seat.
Note that there may be multiple seats or students in the same position at the beginning.
Example 1:
Input: seats = [3,1,5], students = [2,7,4]
Output: 4
Explanation: The students are moved as follows:
- The first student is moved from position 2 to position 1 using 1 move.
- The second student is moved from position 7 to position 5 using 2 moves.
- The third student is moved from position 4 to position 3 using 1 move.
In total, 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 moves were used.
Example 2:
Input: seats = [4,1,5,9], students = [1,3,2,6]
Output: 7
Explanation: The students are moved as follows:
- The first student is not moved.
- The second student is moved from position 3 to position 4 using 1 move.
- The third student is moved from position 2 to position 5 using 3 moves.
- The fourth student is moved from position 6 to position 9 using 3 moves.
In total, 0 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 7 moves were used.
Example 3:
Input: seats = [2,2,6,6], students = [1,3,2,6]
Output: 4
Explanation: Note that there are two seats at position 2 and two seats at position 6.
The students are moved as follows:
- The first student is moved from position 1 to position 2 using 1 move.
- The second student is moved from position 3 to position 6 using 3 moves.
- The third student is not moved.
- The fourth student is not moved.
In total, 1 + 3 + 0 + 0 = 4 moves were used.*/
