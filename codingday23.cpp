/*Given a positive integer n, return the punishment number of n.
The punishment number of n is defined as the sum of the squares of all integers i such that:
1 <= i <= n
The decimal representation of i * i can be partitioned into contiguous substrings such that the sum of the integer values of these substrings equals i.
 Example 1:
Input: n = 10
Output: 182
Explanation: There are exactly 3 integers i in the range [1, 10] that satisfy the conditions in the statement:
- 1 since 1 * 1 = 1
- 9 since 9 * 9 = 81 and 81 can be partitioned into 8 and 1 with a sum equal to 8 + 1 == 9.
- 10 since 10 * 10 = 100 and 100 can be partitioned into 10 and 0 with a sum equal to 10 + 0 == 10.
Hence, the punishment number of 10 is 1 + 81 + 100 = 182
Example 2:
Input: n = 37
Output: 1478
Explanation: There are exactly 4 integers i in the range [1, 37] that satisfy the conditions in the statement:
- 1 since 1 * 1 = 1. 
- 9 since 9 * 9 = 81 and 81 can be partitioned into 8 + 1. 
- 10 since 10 * 10 = 100 and 100 can be partitioned into 10 + 0. 
- 36 since 36 * 36 = 1296 and 1296 can be partitioned into 1 + 29 + 6.
Hence, the punishment number of 37 is 1 + 81 + 100 + 1296 = 1478*/

/*Final Array State After K Multiplication Operations I
You are given an integer array nums, an integer k, and an integer multiplier.
You need to perform k operations on nums. In each operation:
Find the minimum value x in nums. If there are multiple occurrences of the minimum value, select the one that appears first.
Replace the selected minimum value x with x * multiplier.
Return an integer array denoting the final state of nums after performing all k operations.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,1,3,5,6], k = 5, multiplier = 2
Output: [8,4,6,5,6]
Explanation:
Operation	Result
After operation 1	[2, 2, 3, 5, 6]
After operation 2	[4, 2, 3, 5, 6]
After operation 3	[4, 4, 3, 5, 6]
After operation 4	[4, 4, 6, 5, 6]
After operation 5	[8, 4, 6, 5, 6]
Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2], k = 3, multiplier = 4
Output: [16,8]
Explanation:
Operation	Result
After operation 1	[4, 2]
After operation 2	[4, 8]
After operation 3	[16, 8]*/
